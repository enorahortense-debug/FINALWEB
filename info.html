        <h2>About Us</h2>

        <p>
            I have been a Twilight fan since my young age — from the very moment the saga was released.
            I watched every film, followed every chapter of the story, and grew up alongside the world of Forks.
        </p>

        <p>
            As I grew older, my love for the saga only deepened. I read every book, discovered every detail,
            and became what I proudly call a <strong>Twilight saga lover and reader-aholic</strong>.
        </p>

        <p>
            From the heart of a fan, I want to thank <strong>Stephenie Meyer</strong> — a truly great author.
            In 2003, she dreamed of a pale vampire and a human girl meeting in a forest.
            That single dream became a universe, a romance, and a fantasy that millions of us now carry in our hearts.
            And I want to thank all the people behind this boostore, that are helping me and supporting my dream.
        </p>

        <p>
            That dream transformed our imaginations, our emotions, and our love for storytelling.
            Inspired by this world, I created this online bookstore to give other fans the opportunity
            to relive the magic, to dive deeper into the story, and to discover — or rediscover —
            the Twilight saga through its books.
        </p>
